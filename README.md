# TrustlessExpenseSplitter DApp

A decentralized application for trustless expense splitting using Ethereum smart contracts with a **factory pattern** for creating multiple independent expense groups.

## üåü Features

- **Factory Pattern**: Create unlimited expense splitter groups from a single deployed factory
- **Multi-Group Management**: Users can be members of multiple splitter groups
- **MetaMask Integration**: Secure wallet connection
- **Deposit Management**: Add and withdraw ETH with reserved funds protection
- **Expense Proposals**: Propose shared expenses with custom participant splits
- **Multi-Party Approval**: Expenses require approval from all participants
- **Reserved Deposits**: Funds are reserved upon approval to prevent race conditions
- **Transaction History**: View all group activities
- **Member Dashboard**: Real-time balance and group information

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contracts

1. **TrustlessExpenseSplitterFactory.sol** (Deploy this)
   - Creates new splitter instances
   - Tracks all splitters
   - User splitter lookup

2. **TrustlessExpenseSplitter.sol** (Auto-deployed by factory)
   - Manages one group's expenses
   - Independent instance per group

### React Application

- React 19.x
- React Router 7.x for navigation
- Web3.js for blockchain interaction
- ethers.js for utilities
- Modular component architecture

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ installed
- MetaMask browser extension
- Sepolia testnet ETH

### Installation

```bash
cd react_test_proj
npm install
```

### Configuration

1. Deploy `TrustlessExpenseSplitterFactory.sol` to testnet (see FACTORY_PATTERN_GUIDE.md)
2. Update `src/contracts/config.js`:
   - Set `FACTORY_ADDRESS` to your deployed factory address
   - Paste `FACTORY_ABI` from compilation
   - Paste `SPLITTER_ABI` from compilation

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

1. **Connect MetaMask** ‚Üí Login with your wallet
2. **View Splitters** ‚Üí See all your expense groups
3. **Create Splitter** ‚Üí Start a new group with members
4. **Select Splitter** ‚Üí Choose which group to manage
5. **Manage Expenses** ‚Üí Deposit, propose, approve, execute
6. **Withdraw Funds** ‚Üí Get your remaining balance back

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
